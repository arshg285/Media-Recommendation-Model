# PIC-16B-Project
This repository contains a descriptive tutorial and all the code for Hiral Kotecha and Arsh Gupta's project for PIC 16B taken at UCLA during the Fall 2021 quarter. The project is titled "Intersectionality in the Film Industry" and is focused around promoting diversity and representation of marginalized communities in said industry. In this project, we have built a TV shows and movies recommender system which will suggest most relevant titles to the user based on their preferred characteristics and preferred representations that they wish to see in their entertainment choices.
